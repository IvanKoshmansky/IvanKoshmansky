### Hi everyone, I'm Ivan.
I became interested in android development in 2020.
I have completed several educational courses
where I learned the basics of mobile development and examples of writing
applications according to the patterns and architecture recommended by google.
My practical development began with an optional assignment,
which I received at my current job.
It was necessary to write a small application that monitors data
from special measuring devices for the needs of the service department.
The application was written and tested in operation.
Then I decided to improve my practical skills and implement for this
several PetProjects.
The first application monitors information about SpaceX launches,
and the second, which is currently under development,
will allow you to view the layout of rooms and interiors for Planner5D projects
that are publicly available.
I am regularly interested in updates released by the developers
of the operating system and adapt my code according to new recommendations.
I have a higher technical education.
